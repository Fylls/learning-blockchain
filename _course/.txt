Again, welcome to this course on building a blockchain and a cryptocurrency.
By the end of this course, you will know how blockchains work at the core, and how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are implemented.

The next few videos introduce the core concepts of the Blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
You will find them helpful if you want a more well-rounded understanding of the main features of both the blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
